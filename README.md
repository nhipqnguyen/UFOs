# UFOs
# Project Overview
Our assignment is to visualize UFO sightings by customizing a webpage using the Bootstrap framework, and equipping a table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations. 

## Challenge Overview
After creating the webpage with UFO sightings that allows user to filter the data by date, we provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js

## Results
- Below is a screenshot of the webpage before we apply any filters:

- We can filter multiple criteria at the same time. We just need to type in the search term in each filter box in the given format and press Tab or Enter. For example, below is a screenshot of the web page after we type "el cajon" in the "city" filter box and "triangle" in the "shape" filter box.

## Summary
- One drawback of this webpage is that though it allows users to filter sightings based on multiple criteria, it does not have a sort button that allows users to sort the data in different ways/ columns.
- Two additional recommendations for further development:
  - We can add a sort function to columns "Date", "City", "State", "Country" that allows users to sort each column in ascending/ descending order.
  - We can add a filter to the "Duration" column that allows users to set a minimum or maximum duration. For example, users will be able to filter the sightings that were longer than 6 minutes or shorter than 12 minutes.
